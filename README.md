2. Press Ctrl + Shift + i or F12 to open the developer tools

3. Go to the networks tab

4. Press F5 ro reload the site
5. Find this file with this pattern dddddddddd_ddddddddddddd here it is 0000805135_3931571958146, copy the filename. This file is called the "blob-file" which contains all the data from this class.
 Some events have a differently named blob file. E.g "0000790631_relayLeg_01_3932043026164"\
 The pattern usually looks likw this dddddddddd_*ddddddddddddd \
